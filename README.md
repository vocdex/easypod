# easypod
A service to edit audio files by transcription. Best for podcast hosts, audio recorders, and pet projects.

## Idea
You have recorded an hour long podcast with your friend and you know you have made a few grammatical mistakes,   
have said things you should not have said. Now, you have to search where exactly you made that mistake and correct it.  
**easypod** allows you to locate that mistake in your audio file by providing you a transcription of the file. In that way, 
you can just read the transcription and delete that word(s) and replace them with something else.  
**easypod** synthesizes your voice to the audio file and it sounds like you actually have pronounced those newly added words.
