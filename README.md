# easypod
A service to edit audio files by transcription. Best for podcast hosts, audio recorders, and pet projects.

## Idea
Say you have recorded an hour long podcast and you are too embarrassed to release this podcast with grammatical errors, "umm", "yeah" sounds in between.   
How do you efficiently search for such mistakes and edit/delete?  Here comes EasyPod!
<br>

EasyPod allows you to
 * locate that mistake in your audio file by providing you a transcription of the file. In that way, you can just read the transcription and delete that word(s) and replace them with something else.  
 * synthesize your voice to the newly added words and make them sound like you.
